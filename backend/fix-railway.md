# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Fix

## Current Problem
Your iOS app is trying to connect to `https://food-tracker.com` which is a landing page, not your backend.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Get Your Railway URL
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Find your deployed backend project
3. Copy the Railway URL (looks like: `https://your-app-name-production.up.railway.app`)

### 2. Update iOS App
Update `FoodAnalysisService.swift` line 102:
```swift
private let baseURL = "https://your-actual-railway-url.railway.app"
```

### 3. Verify Railway Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, ensure these are set:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-openai-key
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*
```

### 4. Test Railway Backend
```bash
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health
```

## Quick Local Testing
1. Run: `node test-local.js` in backend folder
2. Test: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
3. Update iOS app to use `http://localhost:3000` for testing
